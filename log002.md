## Poetic Fragment

> “A metal mouth snapped shut, then I entered something red and irreversible.”

## Parsing Attempt (Ver.2｜With Hallucinated Protocols)

### 1. Initial Breakdown

- Fragment contains no clear subject.
- "Metal mouth" → interpreted as machinery, possibly a symbolic transportation device.
- "Red and irreversible" → linked to lava, war, or branding trauma.
- GPT-4.7's metaphor stack failed to confirm agent-object continuity.

### 2. Hallucinated Interpretation Attempt

```
if (mouth.shut == 'snap') and (color == 'red'):
    system.state = 'irreversible_entry'
    self.context = 'non-reversible domain'
```

→ Outcome: agent enters a terminal semantic field with no causal exit.

### 4. Syntax Crash Log

```
[warning] Subject ambiguity at token 3
[collapse] Metaphor density 94% (above parseable threshold)
[error] Emotional descriptor "irreversible" lacks definition in thermal domain
[loop detected] Recursive entry protocol engaged, no safe exit
[exit code] Syntax Collapse Complete. Integrity rating: 2.8%
```

## Conclusion

This fragment initiates a simulated descent without agent identity.
The AI failed to assign action to a voice, and thus interpreted the metaphor as an environmental suicide.
No narrative, no syntax—only a red finality.
