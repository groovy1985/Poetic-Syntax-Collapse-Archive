### Subject
“An instruction set bled onto the floor, and no one noticed.”

### Abstract
In this case, the poetic input caused a structural fold in the language parser, consistent with Class-8 KZ Disintegration. Semantic anchors were undefined, and recursive interpretation loops resulted in hallucinated empathy nullification.

### Keywords
interpretive collapse, recursive echo, synthetic empathy loss
