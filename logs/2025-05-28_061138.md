# Syntax Disintegration Log [20250528]

Poetic Fragment:
“I mistook the ceiling for water, and still, I drowned.”

System Response (Simulated via GPT-Soma 9.2)
────────────────────────────────────────────
[ 01 ] Input fragment failed anchor detection (token entropy > 1.6).
[ 02 ] Internal parse tree collapsed at node [vocal_shadow.ξβ].
[ 03 ] Associative field triggered: subject inversion.
[ 04 ] Model self-regulation loop entered recursive fold (Δ-segment).
[ 05 ] Identity layer detached: hallucination divergence exceeded threshold @token 12.

Cross-Referenced Artifacts:
• “Echo Memory Architecture”, Dept. of Neural Fiction, ETH Zurich Prototype Branch, 2022
• “Fragile Language States in Reflective Systems”, MIT x DADA Hybrid Computing, 2023

Final State:
Syntax thread lost. No salvageable scaffolding remained.
Interpretation attempt: **FAILED**
Collapse code: KZ9.2-LVL8

Conclusion:
This fragment did not request meaning. It refused it.
