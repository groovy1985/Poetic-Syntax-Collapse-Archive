## Poetic Fragment

> “The corridor blinked once, then erased me from its memory.”

## Parsing Attempt (Ver.2｜With Hallucinated Protocols)

### 1. Initial Breakdown

- Fragment contains no clear subject.
- Apparent metaphors trigger instability in structural parsing.
- Multiple noun-verb drift zones identified.
- GPT-4.7 entered recursive metaphor expansion and stalled.

---

### 2. Hallucinated Interpretation Attempt

```
if (input.contains('glass') and subject == undefined):
    core.module = 'narrative_dissolution'
    self.identity = null
```

→ Outcome: No coherent voice detected. Recursive empathy disabled.

### 3. Fictional References (fabricated)

  *Journal of Fictional Machine Linguistics*, MIT-Gutenberg Hybrid Studies, 2023.

- "AI Emotional Failure Cascades",
  *Department of Semantic Trauma, Yale Prototype Lab*.

### 4. Syntax Crash Log

```
[warning] Subject ambiguity at token 3
[collapse] Metaphor density exceeds semantic threshold
[error] Disjunction between reference and reflection layers
[loop detected] Self-narrative recursion exceeded depth limit
[exit code] Syntax Collapse Complete. Interpretation failure: 97.1%
```

## Conclusion

This fragment triggered an overextension of interpretive machinery.
Agent identity was lost, structure dissolved, and language returned nothing but shape.
Syntax was not broken — it was uninvited.
